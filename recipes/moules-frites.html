			<li>Olive oil</li>
			<li>Egg yolk</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper</li>
			<li>Lemon juice</li>
			<li>Mustard</li>

		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Place a large rimmed baking sheet in oven; preheat to 220Â°C. Bring a
				kettle of water to a boil.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place potato wedges in a medium bowl and cover with boiling water. Let
				stand for 5 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Toss with 1 tablespoon oil, 1/4
				teaspoon ground pepper, salt and cayenne in the medium bowl. Spread the
				wedges in a single layer on the preheated pan. Bake, flipping once,
				until golden and crispy, 25 to 30 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Meanwhile, whisk egg yolk, 1 teaspoon parsley, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon
				shallot, mustard and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl.
				While whisking, drizzle in 2 tablespoons oil until blended. Set aside.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add
				leek and the remaining 1 tablespoon shallot; cook, stirring
				occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add mussels, wine and the
				remaining 1 tablespoon parsley. Cover and steam until the mussels open,
				3 to 5 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Transfer the mussels to a large serving bowl and top with scallions and
				crushed red pepper, if desired. Serve the mussels and potato wedges with
				the aioli for dipping.
			</li>
		</ol>
